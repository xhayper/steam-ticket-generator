# Steam Ticket Generator

This project provides an implementation of a encrypted app ticket generator for Steam. The generated ticket can then be used to run games that require a valid ticket to check for game ownership (ex. Denuvo protected games).

**Note:** Denuvo protected games will also require to have the correct steam account id in the steam emulator settings.

## Usage

1. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

    The resulting binary will be located in `target/release/steam_ticket_generator.exe`.

2. **Provide the steam_api64.dll file:**

    Place the `steam_api64.dll` file in the same directory as the generated binary. This file is required to comunicate with the local Steam client.

3. **Run the generator:**

    Open steam on your computer, log in with the account you wish to use for the generation then run the program.
    Input the game's AppID when prompted. The program will use the currently logged in account to generate the ticket.
    It will output both the user's SteamID and the generated ticket in base64 format.

4. **Use the generated ticket:**
    It is possible to use the generated ticket with [GittyGittyKit's GBE Fork](https://github.com/GittyGittyKit/gbe_fork/releases) (that recently [merged](https://github.com/Detanup01/gbe_fork/pull/274) into the Detanup's fork 🎉).
    Copy the generated SteamID and ticket to `configs.user.ini` in the `account_steamid` and `ticket` fields respectively.
    ```ini
    [user::general]
    account_steamid=YOUR_STEAM_ID
    ticket=BASE64_ENCODED_TICKET
    ```
